# React in Rust

The idea is to clone (a subset of) React in Rust, keeping it as close as possible to the
original, even carrying over features and problems that don't make a lot of sense in
Rust.

This idea came to me when I was thinking about how javascript's quirks and limitations
influenced how its frameworks function. I was really curious to see what would it take to
transfer these behaviors to a language with a different set of quirks and limitations.

## Why

This is mostly a recreational project, and I don't intend for it to be feature complete or
nice to use.

## Is it any good?

No.
